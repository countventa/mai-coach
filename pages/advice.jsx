      These tips are personal advice, meaning they may vary depending on the individual. I’m sharing them to help you out! 😉
      
        I / My Mass Gain Plan
            • 🍽️ 3000 kcal/day — 293g carbs, 150g protein, 129g fat
            (Calories distribution: Breakfast 15%, Lunch 30%, Dinner 35%, Snacks 20%)
            • 💧 2.5L (minimum) of water per day
            • 🚶‍♂️ 10,000 steps per day


        II / Supplements (optional but useful)
            • ⚡ Creatine: 7g/day → post-workout
            • 🥤 Whey Gainer: 100g + water → post-workout
            • 🌿 Ashwagandha (if stressed, anxious, or having sleep issues): 500mg before bed


        III / Rest
            🛌 Rest is extremely important for building muscle — no rest = no muscle growth.
            I recommend getting at least 8 hours of sleep per night (minimum).

            ⏱️ During your workout, take at least 2 min 30 sec of rest between sets.
